# Reactivities

Reactivities is a social media application where users can create and share events with other users. It was created by following the Udemy course ['Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React'](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react/) by Neil Cummings. My own version of the app is hosted at https://reactivities-jarredm.herokuapp.com/.
